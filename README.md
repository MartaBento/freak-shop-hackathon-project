# hackathon-project
Our hackathon project for &lt;Academia de CÃ³digo_>, between 08/08 and 09/08.

// The Idea
Our hackathon theme was Hip-Hop and a song was given to each group, randomly.
Our group had the song "Get Ur Freak On" (Missy Elliott), so we needed to create something inspired by the song.
We decided to create a "decoy" website (for demonstrating purposes only), that appeared to be a casual website, but when you logged in, you were redirected to a special website, our project, a shop that sells erotic toys for elderly people.
